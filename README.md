Python API Client

There are three JSON files in this directory which contain response data from an API:
- `campaign_statistics.json`
- `campaigns.json`
- `creatives.json`

Build a Python client to call the different endpoints for this API.
The client must be able to:
- Authenticate using an API key
- Paginate

To test the client there is a Flask app in `app.py`.
To run the Flask app do the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

``
flask run
``# API-Client
